OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT

User Input:
The user types a query, and the input is preprocessed to remove stopwords and perform lemmatization.
Keyword Matching:
The processed input is matched against predefined keywords in the response_bank.
Response:
If a match is found, the chatbot provides the corresponding response. Otherwise, it gives a default reply.
Exiting the Chat:
Typing "exit", "quit", or "bye" ends the session.

Enhancements
Dynamic Responses: Use machine learning models like a chatbot built on transformers (e.g., Hugging Face's Transformers library) for more sophisticated replies.
Context Handling: Implement dialogue history tracking to maintain context between user queries.
API Integration: Integrate APIs (e.g., weather or Wikipedia) for real-time responses.
